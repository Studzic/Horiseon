# Horiseon

In this lesson we used developer tools to help refractor the given code.
We were tasked with organizing and optimizing the code so others could easily read and re-write it. 
In this case a lot of the code was given individual classes, by grouping them under one content article tag, I was able to reduce the number of lines of code and complete the task.
